# Project Timer

A [FitbitOS](https://www.fitbit.com/fitbitos) app to quickly set a timer based on predefined durations.  
When the time is up the watch will vibrate.  
Built to replace my [Cube Timer](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Miracle-Cube-Timer-5-15-30-60-Timer-Maker-Yoga-Timer-Nap-Timer/32849299610.html) which was driving my coworkers crazy.
